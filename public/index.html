                        Recently I started making things out of leather. The first thing I made was a simple card wallet. Basically just three rectangles of leather stacked and stitched together. The leather in question was from my old pair of boots that had too many holes in them to be salvaged by a resole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I‚Äôm proud to say that in the process I managed to avoid falling victim to the affliction that affects many of us when we're starting a new hobby or just doing something for the first time. I'm of course talking about the dreaded <a href="https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/48282">Gear Acquisition Syndrome</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, G.A.S is most common in amatuer musicians and photographers. Unfortunately for me, I'm both. Sit down, and let me tell you a tale by the fireside of the boy who blew all his pocket money trying to sound like his favourite indie pop rockers and shoot film like a super cool hipster or something and where he is now.

                        <i>Cut to semi-rural central otago, 2016. I've just entered year 12. I'm broke (I mean, obviously. I was 16 at the time).</i>

                        After some pleading, I managed to convince my parents to buy me a guitar. It was an ovation with a curved plastic back. It looked nothing like what I had seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc7Z0G4znAA">Ragnar</a> playing. It wasn't a "cool" guitar but I played that thing every day. I'd be dying to get home from school so I could open ultimate guitar and start playing. I didn't know how much a good guitar could cost, I'd never set foot in a music store, and thankfully I'd never heard the word tonewood. I was a terrible player and I knew it. When we're true beginners we know the toold aren't the thing keeping us from excelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trouble comes a little further down the track. When we begin to have the first inkling of knowing what we're doing. Imagine how much better this would sound on a "real" guitar! Imagine the beautiful photos I could take if I had a Cannon 5d mk3!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the point in starting something new where I tend to start googling. Spending many late nights after school watching gear reviews. Once I learned what a guitar pedal was, it was all over. I went from rushing home to practice to rushing home to watch some fool talk about his favourite looper. It's not that I wasn't playing. It's just that if the time I wasted watching edutainment was instead spent enjoying creating with the tool I already had, I would be a much better player today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can guess what happened when I started working. I saved up and bought these things I had seen on the internet. I got an amp, and an electric guitar, eventually pedals. But none of them made me a better player. Sure, new gear is fun to tinker around with, but I'd rather go back to being home from school with nothing but time to burn and a cheap guitar in hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok, that was a bit dramatic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The point is that at many points over my life, not having the perfect gear for the job has stopped me from creating. In some ways the same is true of this site. I've wanted to have my own website for a long time, but I didn't start this until I had already completed a bachelors degree in computer science and had been working as a Software Developer for a few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm proud to say that I'm starting to kick this habit, and ashamed that it's taken me this long.

                        Last month I again tried something new. I built a table. It was the first piece of non-kitset furniture I‚Äôd ever made. To my surprise (and the relief of the missus) I ended up with a relatively presentable, if a bit rustic final result. Armed with a friends garage, a borrowed drill, a tin of wood stain/varnish, an orbital sander<a href="#gasFootnote1">[1]</a>, some scaffholding planks, and the cheapest kiln-dried timber that money can buy. I got it done, and I bet if I did it again with the same tools, it wouldn't even take me an entire week of spare time.

                        [1] Ok! So I did buy the sander... But it's definately different because I didn't know anyone who owns one and I would have been afraid of breaking it if I did ok!?

                        It is my goal that everything on my site (except the links section but duh) should be made by me. I don't really want to respond directly to other media. I want to create new things. Recently I came to the horrible realisation that every time this page is loaded, it's using a font made by someone else. Even worse, that font can be different depending on what browser/device you use which sometimes caused things to be slightly out of alignment.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'prototypeMinimono2025-02-16';">
                        The simple solution was to make my own font. As you probably guessed, this is it. Here's all the characters:
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'prototypeMinimono2025-02-16'; font-size: 25px;">

                        I went for a minimal, blocky look. It's fine. The file size is small, but it's no work of art.

                    <p>
                        Do you care about this? Is this interesting to anyone except for me? Should I care if it isn't?

                    <p>
                        In making this font, I thought this might be a good thing to write about until I considered; Are most of the entries on this site just going to be about making the site? And if so, is that interesting?

                        A blog about making a blog is only interesting to someone learning how to make a blog, and even then maybe just as a means to an end. Sculptors don't spend all day making statues of chisels, and the best books aren't about publishing or overcoming writer's block. These examples seem silly, but for some reason, on the internet (and especially the blog space) people seem to constantly write about writing on the internet.

                        I aim to avoid this from now on.

                        Oh, and by the way. I'm not happy enough with this font to go on using it for the whole site. I may get around to making another one.

                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        I've been using a "dumbphone" for I think about a year now. It can only use SMS and make/receive calls. It has no internet connection. I hold this as one of the best decisions I ever made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although I had already taken steps to limit my social media; I had deleted Instagram and Facebook off of my smartphone a year prior. Here in New Zealand most people I know use Facebook Messenger as their main avenue for communication. I was worried about losing contact with friends and family. Ah, the dreaded FOMO. Eventually I decided to try it "just for a couple of days". I grabbed an $80 candy barphone on my way home  from work and all my apprehensions melted away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, what about that FOMO?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It turns out that for the most part people who care about you are willing to send you a text message instead of a Facebook DM. And I started treating the group chat more like an email chain. I could check it on my computer at work an hour before leaving work to see if there were any invites to events and that pretty much solved my problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What about banking? I set up my debit card so that
                        CHQ/Paywave accesses my weekly budget and SAV
                        accesses my
                        short term savings. This means that if I will never be
                        somewhere and not have access to money. Maps?
                        I look
                        up the directions before I leave, if it's complicated
                        I'll write them down in a notebook I carry.
                        Email?
                        Why do you need to see emails at the pub??? Do it when
                        you get home!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok, here's the part where I admit that I've been lying
                        to you. It turned out that I actually
                        couldn't live my
                        normal life without a smartphone. My work, my bank,
                        steam, and a lot of other things require an
                        authenticator
                        app for login. My gym requires an app FFS. Also, what if
                        I want to listen to music? Well... For this
                        I still
                        use a smartphone and a Digital Audio Player (effectively
                        a tiny android tablet). The smartphone
                        stays in my
                        drawer at work and the DAP stays at home.

                        So far I've only talked about the issues with using a
                        dumbphone. If you're a full time smartphone
                        user
                        this whole thing probably sounds silly to you. It did to
                        me the first time I heard about someone
                        using
                        a candybar phone in the 2020s. Modern smartphones are
                        arguably the most effective tool that humanity
                        has
                        ever created. Why would anyone want to give that up? Put
                        simply,
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke0lFon3UhU&list=PLgKGxseK8LoUg9T4YT4DsQEBRLoTltEKd&index=62">
                            there are hidden costs to owning a smartphone</a>.

                    <p>
                        Although I was already vigilant about managing
                        notifications and unsubscribing from bullshit emails,
                        there are always things that slip through the cracks. Do
                        I really need that group chat notification
                        in the middle of fixing an issue at work? Or when
                        enjoying time with friends? The benefit of the
                        dumbphone is that I know that when it beeps, someone is
                        actively trying to get in contact with me
                        specifically. Not just someone sending me a meme or
                        sharing a post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've found that since switching, my time out of the
                        house has had a completely different vibe to it.
                        There are few objects in out lives that spend the same
                        amount of time with us as our phones so a
                        change
                        affects a lot more of your life than you may think. I no
                        longer have a 24/7 entertainment machine on
                        me
                        at all times. Whenever I am out of the house, I am
                        present. The lack of a phone changes sitting in a
                        waiting
                        room, being on the bus, or otherwise waiting somewhere.
                        When I'm bored I'm compelled to talk to the
                        people
                        around me, take in my surroundings, or just go into my
                        own mind. When I wake up in the morning I get
                        straight out of bed. No more wasted time scrolling. I've
                        also noticed that I sleep much better.
                        Something
                        else I did not expect is how much more I notice the
                        people around me being on their phones.

                        Using a dumbphone is one of those things where the
                        drawbacks are clear, but the benefits are
                        indirect. You
                        really need to give it a go to know what you will gain
                        and whether the drawbacks will actually apply
                        to you.
                        I implore you to give it a go, even just to try it out
                        for a couple of days. The only piece of
                        advice I will
                        give to you is that
                        <a

                            is no such thing as the perfect
                            dumbphone</a>.
                        So don't get hung up on finding it. Just walk into the
                        store and buy the cheapest one available. If
                        you must
                        have a specific recommendation; the
                        <a

                        is very simple to use and I have had no issues with it.

                    <p>
                        Most phones have a screen time feature, check it and see
                        if that would convince you. Do you think
                        you are going
                        to look back in 5 years and wish you spent more time
                        staring at a screen or less. The quote "The
                        only people
                        that will remember you worked late are your kids" has
                        always stuck with me and I think applies here.

                        Go on, see if those T9 typing skills are still in the
                        mind palace somewhere.

                    <p>
                        In the last year or so I have made an effort to change
                        the type of content I have been
                        consuming.
                        My goal was to switch to content that was slower and
                        focused on the real world. This was inspired by
                        being
                        suggested one of
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvanMonsma">Evan
                            Monsma</a>'s videos

                        The video and audio quality are not great but the
                        vibe is relaxing and he tells a story.

                        I think his videos do the best job of expressing the
                        vibe I want to capture in this website.

                    <p>
                        I want to present my hobbies here in a low-effort and casual way. In the past I have held 
                        high standards for what constitutes as being "worth sharing" and this has lead to not releasing anything I make.
                        Perfectionism is the enemy of just getting
                        something out there.

                        Evan uses the end-tag "Made for the sake of making"
                        which speaks to me.
